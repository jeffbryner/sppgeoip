What? 

These are qmail-spp modules you can use in the qmail smtp chain of events
to control or log connections by country. 

See: http://qmail-spp.sourceforge.net/doc/ for details on the module. 

What do they do? 

sppgeoip.py just logs the source country of an incoming smtp connection in the header of an email: 
	X-SPP-GEOIP: US: United States

sppgeoipauth.py will whitelist countries you'll accept authentication attempts from and log success/failures.
	To set your list of countries change: 
		allowed=['US']
	to allowed=['US','UK','FR'] or whatever list of country codes you want to login via smtp.

qmail setup: 
	To enable the modules, configure your /var/qmail/control/smtpplugins file thusly: 

	# plugins to execute on client's connection
	[connection]
	plugins/sppgeoip.py

	# plugins to execute on AUTH command
	[auth]
	plugins/sppgeoipauth.py

Make sure all the .py files are executable (chmod +x *.py) or nothing but fail will happen.

Feel free to mod the sppgeoip.py if you want to whitelist/blacklist by country.
